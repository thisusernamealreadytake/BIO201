A difference between the males and females of a species is called a sexual dimorphism.
Divergent traits may be adaptive for the two sexes for ecological reasons, as when males and females eat different foods.
This appears to be the case in the purple-throated carib.
Male eats from Heliconia caribaea, but female eats from Heliconia bihai.
Heliconia bihai has longer and more tightly curved flowers than H. caribaea.
The longer and more tightly curved beaks of female purple-throated caribs appear to be adaptive because they enable the females to exploit H. bihai flowers more easily.

Consider, for a moment, life without sex.
For organisms that reproduce without sex (see Chapter 8), getting genes into the
next generation is straightforward, if not always easy. The two big challenges are
surviving to adulthood, then reproducing. Sex adds a third major challenge: finding
a member of the opposite sex and persuading him or her to cooperate.
